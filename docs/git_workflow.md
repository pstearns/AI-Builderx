# Git Workflow

**Strategy**  
Trunk based development with short lived feature branches. No squash merges so that grading can see incremental history.

**Branch names**  
feat slash backend auth  
feat slash frontend tasks ui  
test slash e2e smoke  
chore slash ci

**Commits**  
Conventional Commits without emojis. Atomic and readable. Target three to eight meaningful commits per active day.

**Pull requests**  
Small scope preferred. Use the template and keep continuous integration green.
